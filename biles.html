    <main><h1>About Biles</h1> <!-- heading for the main-->
        <p>Simone Arianne Biles was born on March 14, 1997, in Columbus, Ohio, the third of four siblings. Her birth mother, Shanon Biles, was unable to care for Biles or her other children – Ashley, Tevin, and Adria – due to her drug and alcohol addiction, so the children were in and out of foster care. Biles' birth father, Kelvin Clemons, abandoned his family, struggled with addictions, and was never present in his daughter's life. With the help of his second wife, Nellie Cayetano Biles, Shanon's father Ron (who has two nearly-adult sons, Ron Jr. and Adam), began temporarily caring for Shanon's children in 2000, in the north Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, after finding out his grandchildren got placed into foster care. In 2003, the couple officially adopted the two youngest children, Simone and Adria, and Ron's sister Harriet, adopted the two oldest. Biles holds Belize citizenship through her mother and refers to Belize as being her second home.
